# About

In this project we try to predict the airline customer satisfaction based on several factors like: gender, age, travel class, etc.
Understanding customer satisfaction is very important for airlines as it provides directions to improve the service and equipment. 
The right improvement, subsequently, will increase the revenue. Additionally, it will be easier to build customer loyalty.
Loyal customers often promote the airline through word-of-mouth or positive reviews, reducing the cost of acquiring new customers.
Thus, the reasons to conduct the project are many. The main question is: <b>can we accurately predict the customer satisfaction from the information we have? </b>

The dataset we use to answer this question was sourced in Kaggle, posted by [@teejmahal20](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20) (TJ Klein). It is important to note that the dataset was originally posted by [@johndddddd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction), which is then modified and cleaned by [@teejmahal20](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20).
