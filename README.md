# US Airline Customer Satisfaction Predictor
Authors: Hrayr Muradyan, Azin Piran, Sopuruchi Chisom, Shengjia Yu.

# About

In this project we try to predict US airline customer satisfaction based on several factors like: gender, age, travel class, etc.
Understanding customer satisfaction is very important for airlines as it provides directions to improve the service and equipment. 
The right improvement, subsequently, will translate to an increase in revenue. 

Additionally, it will be easier to build customer loyalty.
This is essential as loyal customers often promote the airline through word-of-mouth or positive reviews, reducing the cost of acquiring new customers (Sadegh Eshaghi, 2024). 

Thus, the reasons to conduct the this analysis are abundant. 
<br/>The main question is: <b>can we accurately predict the customer satisfaction from the information we have? </b>

The dataset we use to answer this question was sourced in Kaggle, posted by [@teejmahal20](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20) (TJ Klein). It is important to note that the dataset was originally posted by [@johndddddd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johndddddd/customer-satisfaction), which is then modified and cleaned by [@teejmahal20](https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20). The full dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). Additionally, the dataset contains **only** US airline data, as mentioned in the original source.

For the recent versions of the dependencies, view the [environment file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/airline-customer-satisfaction-predictor/blob/main/dsci522_environment.yml).

### Installation using Conda Lock

To ensure a reproducible environment with exact dependency versions, you can use the `conda-lock` file. Follow these steps to set up the environment using the lock file:

#### Step 1: Install `conda-lock`

First, make sure that `conda-lock` is installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via Conda:

```bash
conda install conda-lock
```
#### Step 2: Install dependencies using the `conda-lock` file

After `conda-lock` is installed, use the `conda-lock` file to install the environment. Run the following command in the directory containing the 'conda-lock.yml' file:

```bash
conda-lock install
```
#### Step 3: Create and activate the environment
Once the dependencies are installed, create the environment using:

```bash
conda env create --file conda-lock.yml
```
Then, activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate <your-environment-name>
```
